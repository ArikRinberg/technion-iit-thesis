===================

About
-----

A LaTeX class for authoring masters' and doctoral thesis at the Technion IIT, in conformance with the Technion's formatting requirements, and a sample thesis using this LaTeX class, the files and directory structure of which  can serve as a template for a real thesis.

Key Features
------------

- (Hopefully) maintained to be in conformance to the (occasionally changing) [Technion graduate school](http://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/eng)'s [requirements from Ph.D. theses](http://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/eng/FinalProcedures/Editing%20%20Submission%20of%20Thesis.htm) ([Hebrew version](http://www.graduate.technion.ac.il/Heb/Graduation/Thesis_editing.asp)).
- Supports printing _everything_ into a single file, in a single run, with all of the spacing arranged properly. This may sound trivial if you don't write in Hebrew, but it is a small hell to get this all to work without having to insert empty pages in your LaTeX, print sections separately, flip directions of the printed versions etc. No more.
- Has both a pre-thesis-defense mode, for the version sent to your thesis readers, and a post-defense mode for the copies you submit to the library, give to your wife/parents/children etc.
- Lots of other nifty stuff.

Is this actually used or endorsed?
----------------------------------
This class was adopted as the [official Ph.D. thesis template](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/graduate/etc/thesis-template/) of the [Technion Faculty of Computer Science](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/), in 2013. Multiple Ph.D. candidates have used it already, but we don't have any statistics.
